## Retrieving and preserving logs<a name="troubleshooting-v3-get-logs"></a>

EC2 metrics for Head Node and storage, and Head Node log streams are available in the CloudWatch Dashboard created within the cluster: [Amazon CloudWatch dashboard](Monitoring-v3.md#yaml-Monitoring-Logs-CloudWatch)\. 

Logs are a useful resource for troubleshooting issues\. If you want to delete a failing cluster, you should first create an archive of cluster logs\. Follow the following steps to start this process\.

It is possible to archive the logs in S3 or in a local file \(depending on the `--output-file` parameter\)\.

```
$ pcluster export-cluster-logs --cluster-name mycluster --region eu-west-1 \
  --bucket bucketname --bucket-prefix logs
{
  "url": "https://bucketname.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/export-log/mycluster-logs-202109071136.tar.gz?..."
}

# use the --output-file parameter to save the logs locally
$ pcluster export-cluster-logs --cluster-name mycluster --region eu-west-1 \
  --bucket bucketname --bucket-prefix logs --output-file /tmp/archive.tar.gz
{
  "path": "/tmp/archive.tar.gz"
}
```

The archive contains the Amazon CloudWatch Logs streams and AWS CloudFormation stack events from the Head Node and Compute Nodes for the last 14 days, unless specified explicitly in the configuration or in the parameters for the `export-cluster-logs` command\. Please note the command execution may take a while depending on the number of nodes in the cluster and log streams available in CloudWatch Logs\. See [Integration with Amazon CloudWatch Logs](cloudwatch-logs.md) for more details about the available log streams\.

Starting from 3\.0\.0, AWS ParallelCluster preserves CloudWatch Logs by default on cluster deletion\. If you want to delete a cluster and preserve its logs, make sure the cluster configuration does not have `Monitoring > Logs > CloudWatch > DeletionPolicy` set to `Delete`\. Otherwise, change the field to `Retain` and run the `pcluster update-cluster` command\. Then, run `pcluster delete-cluster --cluster-name <cluster_name>` to delete the cluster yet retain the log group thatâ€™s stored in Amazon CloudWatch\.

## Troubleshooting cluster deployment issues<a name="troubleshooting-v3-cluster-deployment"></a>

If your cluster fails to be created and rolls back stack creation, you can look through the log files to diagnose the issue\. The failure message should look like the following:

```
$ pcluster create-cluster --cluster-name mycluster --region eu-west-1 \
 --cluster-configuration cluster-config.yaml
{
  "cluster": {
    "clusterName": "mycluster",
    "cloudformationStackStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS",
    "cloudformationStackArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:xxx:stack/mycluster/1bf6e7c0-0f01-11ec-a3b9-024fcc6f3387",
    "region": "eu-west-1",
    "version": "3.0.0",
    "clusterStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"
  }
}

$ pcluster describe-cluster --cluster-name mycluster --region eu-west-1
{
  "creationTime": "2021-09-06T11:03:47.696Z",
  ...
  "cloudFormationStackStatus": "ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS",
  "clusterName": "mycluster",
  "computeFleetStatus": "UNKNOWN",
  "cloudformationStackArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:xxx:stack/mycluster/1bf6e7c0-0f01-11ec-a3b9-024fcc6f3387",
  "lastUpdatedTime": "2021-09-06T11:03:47.696Z",
  "region": "eu-west-1",
  "clusterStatus": "CREATE_FAILED"
}
```

To diagnose the cluster creation issue you can use the ``pcluster get-cluster-stack-events`` command, by filtering for `CREATE_FAILED` status\. For more information, see [Filtering AWS CLI output](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-filter.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.

```
$ pcluster get-cluster-stack-events --cluster-name mycluster --region eu-west-1 \
  --query 'events[?resourceStatus==`CREATE_FAILED`]'
[
  {
    "eventId": "3ccdedd0-0f03-11ec-8c06-02c352fe2ef9",
    "physicalResourceId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:xxx:stack/mycluster/1bf6e7c0-0f02-11ec-a3b9-024fcc6f3387",
    "resourceStatus": "CREATE_FAILED",
    "resourceStatusReason": "The following resource(s) failed to create: [HeadNode]. ",
    "stackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:xxx:stack/mycluster/1bf6e7c0-0f02-11ec-a3b9-024fcc6f3387",
    "stackName": "mycluster",
    "logicalResourceId": "mycluster",
    "resourceType": "AWS::CloudFormation::Stack",
    "timestamp": "2021-09-06T11:11:51.780Z"
  },
  {
    "eventId": "HeadNode-CREATE_FAILED-2021-09-06T11:11:50.127Z",
    "physicalResourceId": "i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe",
    "resourceStatus": "CREATE_FAILED",
    "resourceStatusReason": "Received FAILURE signal with UniqueId i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe",
    "resourceProperties": "{\"LaunchTemplate\":{\"Version\":\"1\",\"LaunchTemplateId\":\"lt-057d2b1e687f05a62\"}}",
    "stackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:xxx:stack/mycluster/1bf6e7c0-0f02-11ec-a3b9-024fcc6f3387",
    "stackName": "mycluster",
    "logicalResourceId": "HeadNode",
    "resourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "timestamp": "2021-09-06T11:11:50.127Z"
  }
]
```

In the previous example the failure was in the `HeadNode` setup, to debug this kind of issue you can list the log streams available from the head node with the ``pcluster list-cluster-log-streams`` by filtering for `node-type` and then analyzing the log streams content\.

```
$ pcluster list-cluster-log-streams --cluster-name mycluster --region eu-west-1 \
--filters 'Name=node-type,Values=HeadNode'
{
  "logStreams": [
    {
      "logStreamArn": "arn:aws:logs:eu-west-1:xxx:log-group:/aws/parallelcluster/mycluster-202109061103:log-stream:ip-10-0-0-13.i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe.cfn-init",
      "logStreamName": "ip-10-0-0-13.i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe.cfn-init",
      ...
    },
    {
      "logStreamArn": "arn:aws:logs:eu-west-1:xxx:log-group:/aws/parallelcluster/mycluster-202109061103:log-stream:ip-10-0-0-13.i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe.chef-client",
      "logStreamName": "ip-10-0-0-13.i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe.chef-client",
      ...
    },
    {
      "logStreamArn": "arn:aws:logs:eu-west-1:xxx:log-group:/aws/parallelcluster/mycluster-202109061103:log-stream:ip-10-0-0-13.i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe.cloud-init",
      "logStreamName": "ip-10-0-0-13.i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe.cloud-init",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The two primary log streams that you can use to pinpoint initialization errors are:
+  `cfn-init` is the log for the `cfn-init` script\. First check this log stream\. You're likely to see an error like `Command chef failed` in this log\. Look at the lines immediately before this line for more specifics connected with the error message\. For more information, see [cfn\-init](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-init.html)\.
+  `cloud-init` is the log for [cloud\-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/)\. If you don't see anything in `cfn-init`, then try checking this log next\.

You can retrieve the content of the log stream by using the ``pcluster get-cluster-log-events`` \(note the `--limit 5` option to limit the number of retrieved events\):

```
$ pcluster get-cluster-log-events --cluster-name mycluster \
  --region eu-west-1 --log-stream-name ip-10-0-0-13.i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe.cfn-init \
  --limit 5
{
  "nextToken": "f/36370880979637159565202782352491087067973952362220945409/s",
  "prevToken": "b/36370880752972385367337528725601470541902663176996585497/s",

      "timestamp": "2021-09-06T11:11:39.049Z"
    },
    {
      "message": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/opt/aws/bin/cfn-init\", line 176, in <module>\n    worklog.build(metadata, configSets)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cfnbootstrap/construction.py\", line 135, in build\n    Contractor(metadata).build(configSets, self)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cfnbootstrap/construction.py\", line 561, in build\n    self.run_config(config, worklog)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cfnbootstrap/construction.py\", line 573, in run_config\n    CloudFormationCarpenter(config, self._auth_config).build(worklog)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cfnbootstrap/construction.py\", line 273, in build\n    self._config.commands)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cfnbootstrap/command_tool.py\", line 127, in apply\n    raise ToolError(u\"Command %s failed\" % name)",

    },
    {
      "message": "cfnbootstrap.construction_errors.ToolError: Command runpostinstall failed",
      "timestamp": "2021-09-06T11:11:39.049Z"
    },
    {
      "message": "2021-09-06 11:11:49,212 [DEBUG] CloudFormation client initialized with endpoint https://cloudformation.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com",

    },
    {
      "message": "2021-09-06 11:11:49,213 [DEBUG] Signaling resource HeadNode in stack mycluster with unique ID i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe and status FAILURE",
      "timestamp": "2021-09-06T11:11:49.213Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the previous example the failure is due to a `runpostinstall` failure, so strictly related to the content of the custom bootstrap script used in the `OnNodeConfigured` configuration parameter of the ``CustomActions``\.

The head node log streams are available in the CloudWatch Dashboard created within the cluster: [Amazon CloudWatch dashboard](Monitoring-v3.md#yaml-Monitoring-Logs-CloudWatch)\. If there are no log streams available, the failure might be caused by ``CustomActions`` custom bootstrap script or AMIs related issue\. To diagnose the creation issue in this case, create the cluster again using ``pcluster create-cluster``, including the `--rollback-on-failure` parameter set to `false`\. Then, SSH into the cluster:

```
$ pcluster create-cluster --cluster-name mycluster --region eu-west-1 \
  --cluster-configuration cluster-config.yaml --rollback-on-failure false
{
  "cluster": {
    "clusterName": "mycluster",
    "cloudformationStackStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS",
    "cloudformationStackArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:xxx:stack/mycluster/1bf6e7c0-0f01-11ec-a3b9-024fcc6f3387",
    "region": "eu-west-1",
    "version": "3.0.0",
    "clusterStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"
  }
}

$ pcluster ssh --cluster-name mycluster
```

After you're logged into the head node, you should find three primary log files that you can use to pinpoint the error\.
+  `/var/log/cfn-init.log` is the log for the `cfn-init` script\. First check this log\. You're likely to see an error like `Command chef failed` in this log\. Look at the lines immediately before this line for more specifics connected with the error message\. For more information, see [cfn\-init](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-init.html)\.
+  `/var/log/cloud-init.log` is the log for [cloud\-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/)\. If you don't see anything in `cfn-init.log`, then try checking this log next\. 
+  `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log` is the output of commands that were run by [cloud\-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/)\. This includes the output from `cfn-init`\. In most cases, you don't need to look at this log to troubleshoot this type of issue\.

## Troubleshooting scaling issues<a name="troubleshooting-v3-scaling-issues"></a>

This section is relevant to clusters that were installed using AWS ParallelCluster version 3\.0\.0 and later with the Slurm job scheduler\. For more information about configuring multiple queues, see [Configuration of Multiple Queues](configuration-of-multiple-queues-v3.md)\.

If one of your running clusters is experiencing issues, you should place the cluster in a `STOPPED` state by running the following command before you begin to troubleshoot\. This prevents incurring any unexpected costs\.

```
$ pcluster update-compute-fleet --cluster-name mycluster \
   --status STOP_REQUESTED
```

You can list the log streams available from the cluster nodes by using the ``pcluster list-cluster-log-streams`` command and filtering using the `private-dns-name` of one of the failing nodes or the head node\.

```
$ pcluster list-cluster-log-streams --cluster-name mycluster --region eu-west-1 \
 --filters 'Name=private-dns-name,Values=ip-10-0-0-101'
```

Then you can retrieve the content of the log stream to analyze it by using the ``pcluster get-cluster-log-events`` command and passing the `--log-stream-name` corresponding to one of the key logs mentioned in the following section\.

```
$ pcluster get-cluster-log-events --cluster-name mycluster \
--region eu-west-1 --log-stream-name ip-10-0-0-13.i-04e91cc1f4ea796fe.cfn-init
```

Note: The head and compute node log streams are also available in the CloudWatch Dashboard created within the cluster: [Amazon CloudWatch dashboard](Monitoring-v3.md#yaml-Monitoring-Logs-CloudWatch)\. 

### Key logs for debugging<a name="troubleshooting-v3-key-logs"></a>

The following table provides an overview of the key logs for the head node:
+  `/var/log/cfn-init.log` \- This is the AWS CloudFormation init log\. It contains all commands that were run when an instance is set up\. It's useful for troubleshooting initialization issues\.
+  `/var/log/chef-client.log` \- This is the Chef client log\. It contains all commands that were run through Chef/CINC\. It's useful for troubleshooting initialization issues\.
+  `/var/log/parallelcluster/slurm_resume.log` \- This is a `ResumeProgram` log\. It launches instances for dynamic nodes and is useful for troubleshooting dynamic nodes launch issues\.
+  `/var/log/parallelcluster/slurm_suspend.log` \- This is the `SuspendProgram` log\. It's called when instances are terminated for dynamic nodes, and useful for troubleshooting dynamic nodes termination issues\. When you check this log, you should also check the `clustermgtd` log\.
+  `/var/log/parallelcluster/clustermgtd` \- This is the `clustermgtd` log\. It runs as the centralized daemon that manages most cluster operation actions\. It's useful for troubleshooting any launch, termination, or cluster operation issue\.
+  `/var/log/slurmctld.log` \- This is the Slurm control daemon log\. AWS ParallelCluster doesn't make scaling decisions\. Rather, it only attempts to launch resources to satisfy the Slurm requirements\. It's useful for scaling and allocation issues, job\-related issues, and any scheduler\-related launch and termination issues\.

These are the key logs for the compute nodes:
+  `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log` \- This is the [cloud\-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/) log\. It contains all commands that were run when an instance is set up\. It's useful for troubleshooting initialization issues\.
+  `/var/log/parallelcluster/computemgtd` \- This is the `computemgtd` log\. It runs on each compute node to monitor the node in the rare event that `clustermgtd` daemon on the head node is offline\. It's useful for troubleshooting unexpected termination issues\.
+  `/var/log/slurmd.log` \- This is the Slurm compute daemon log\. It's useful for troubleshooting initialization and compute failure related issues\.

### Troubleshooting node initialization issues<a name="troubleshooting-v3-node-init"></a>

This section covers how you can troubleshoot node initialization issues\. This includes issues where the node fails to launch, power up, or join a cluster\.

#### Head node<a name="troubleshooting-v3-node-init.head-node"></a>

Applicable logs:
+  `/var/log/cfn-init.log` 
+  `/var/log/chef-client.log` 
+  `/var/log/parallelcluster/clustermgtd` 
+  `/var/log/parallelcluster/slurm_resume.log` 
+  `/var/log/slurmctld.log` 

Check the `/var/log/cfn-init.log` and `/var/log/chef-client.log` logs or corresponding log streams\. These logs should contain all the actions that were run when the head node is set up\. Most errors that occur during setup should have error messages located in the `/var/log/chef-client.log` log\. If `OnNodeStart` or `OnNodeConfigured` scripts are specified in the configuration of the cluster, double check that the script runs successfully through log messages\.

When a cluster is created, the head node needs to wait for the compute nodes to join the cluster before it can join the cluster\. As such, if the compute nodes fail to join the cluster, then the head node also fails\. You can follow one of these sets of procedures, depending on the type of compute notes you use, to troubleshoot this type of issue:

#### Compute nodes<a name="troubleshooting-v3-node-init.compute-node"></a>
+ Applicable logs:
  + `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`
  + `/var/log/slurmd.log`
+ If compute node is launched, first check `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`, which should contain the setup logs similar to the `/var/log/chef-client.log` log on the head node\. Most errors that occur during setup should have error messages located at the `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log` log\. If pre\-install or post\-install scripts are specified in cluster configuration, check that they ran successfully\.
+ If youâ€™re using a custom AMI with modification to Slurm configuration, then there might be a Slurm related error that prevents the compute node from joining the cluster\. For scheduler related errors, check the `/var/log/slurmd.log` log\.

**Dynamic compute nodes:**
+ Search the `ResumeProgram` log \(`/var/log/parallelcluster/slurm_resume.log`\) for your compute node name to see if `ResumeProgram` was ever called with the node\. \(If `ResumeProgram` wasnâ€™t ever called, you can check the `slurmctld` log \(`/var/log/slurmctld.log`\) to determine if Slurm ever tried to call `ResumeProgram` with the node\)\.
+ Note that incorrect permissions for `ResumeProgram` might cause `ResumeProgram` to fail silently\. If youâ€™re using a custom AMI with modification to `ResumeProgram` setup, check that the `ResumeProgram` is owned by the `slurm` user and has the `744` \(`rwxr--r--`\) permission\.
+ If `ResumeProgram` is called, check to see if an instance is launched for the node\. If no instance was launched, you should be able to see an error message that describes the launch failure\.
+ If the instance is launched, then there might have been a problem during the setup process\. You should see the corresponding private IP address and instance ID from the `ResumeProgram` log\. Moreover, you can look at corresponding setup logs for the specific instance\. For more information about troubleshooting a setup error with a compute node, see the next section\.

 **Static compute nodes:** 
+ Check the `clustermgtd` \(`/var/log/parallelcluster/clustermgtd`\) log to see if instances were launched for the node\. If they werenâ€™t launched, there should be clear error message detailing the launch failure\. 
+ If instance is launched, there's some issue during setup process\. You should see the corresponding private IP address and instance ID from the `ResumeProgram` log\. Moreover, you can look at the corresponding setup logs for the specific instance\. 

### **Troubleshooting unexpected node replacements and terminations**<a name="troubleshooting-unexpected-node-replacements-and-terminations"></a>

This section continues to explore how you can troubleshoot node related issues, specifically when a node is replaced or terminated unexpectedly\.
+ **Applicable logs:**
  + `/var/log/parallelcluster/clustermgtd` \(head node\)
  + `/var/log/slurmctld.log` \(head node\)
  + `/var/log/parallelcluster/computemgtd` \(compute node\)

 **Nodes replaced or terminated unexpectedly** 
+  Check in the `clustermgtd` log \(`/var/log/parallelcluster/clustermgtd`\) to see if `clustermgtd` took the action to replace or terminate a node\. Note that `clustermgtd` handles all normal node maintenance action\.
+  If `clustermgtd` replaced or terminated the node, there should be a message detailing why this action was taken on the node\. If the reason is scheduler related \(for example, because the node is in `DOWN`\), check in `slurmctld` log for more information\. If the reason is Amazon EC2 related, there should be informative message detailing the Amazon EC2 related issue that required the replacement\. 
+  If `clustermgtd` didnâ€™t terminate the node, first check if this was an expected termination by Amazon EC2, more specifically a spot termination\. `computemgtd`, running on a Compute node, can also take an action to terminate a node if `clustermgtd` is determined as unhealthy\. Check `computemgtd` log \(`/var/log/parallelcluster/computemgtd`\) to see if `computemgtd` terminated the node\.

 **Nodes failed ** 
+ Check in `slurmctld` log \(`/var/log/slurmctld.log`\) to see why a job or a node failed\. Note that jobs are automatically re\-queued if a node failed\.
+ If `slurm_resume` reports that node is launched and `clustermgtd`reports after several minutes that thereâ€™s no corresponding instance in Amazon EC2 for that node, the node might fail during setup\. To retrieve the log from a compute \(`/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`\), do the following steps:
  + Submit a job to let Slurm spin up a new node\.
  + After the node starts, enable termination protection using this command\.

    ```
    aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-xyz --disable-api-termination
    ```
  + Retrieve the console output from the node with this command\.

    ```
    aws ec2 get-console-output --instance-id i-xyz --output text
    ```

### **Replacing, terminating, or powering down problematic instances and nodes**<a name="replacing-terminating-or-powering-down-problematic-instances-and-nodes"></a>
+ **Applicable logs:**
  + `/var/log/parallelcluster/clustermgtd` \(head node\)
  + `/var/log/parallelcluster/slurm_suspend.log` \(head node\)
+ In most cases, `clustermgtd` handles all expected instance termination action\. Check in the `clustermgtd` log to see why it failed to replace or terminate a node\.
+ For dynamic nodes failing ``SlurmSettings` Properties`, check in the `SuspendProgram` log to see if `SuspendProgram` was called by `slurmctld` with the specific node as argument\. Note that `SuspendProgram` doesnâ€™t actually perform any action\. Rather, it only logs when itâ€™s called\. All instance termination and `NodeAddr` reset is done by `clustermgtd`\. Slurm puts nodes back into a `POWER_SAVING` state after `SuspendTimeout` automatically\.

### Troubleshooting other known node and job issues<a name="troubleshooting-v3-other-node-job-issues"></a>

Another type of known issue is that AWS ParallelCluster might fail to allocate jobs or make scaling decisions\. With this type of issue, AWS ParallelCluster only launches, terminates, or maintains resources according to Slurm instructions\. For these issues, check the `slurmctld` log to troubleshoot them\.

## Placement groups and instance launch issues<a name="troubleshooting-v3-placemment-groups"></a>

To get the lowest inter\-node latency, use a *placement group*\. A placement group guarantees that your instances are on the same networking backbone\. If there aren't enough instances available when a request is made, an `InsufficientInstanceCapacity` error is returned\. To reduce the possibility of receiving this error when using cluster placement groups, set the ``Networking` Properties` parameter to `true`\.

If you require a high performance shared filesystem, consider using [Amazon FSx for Lustre](http://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/)\.

For more information, see [Troubleshooting instance launch issues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting-launch.html) and [Placement groups roles and limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#concepts-placement-groups) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* 

## Directories that cannot be replaced<a name="troubleshooting-v3-dirs-must-keep"></a>

The following directories are shared between the nodes and cannot be replaced\.
+  `/home` \- This includes the default user home folder \(`/home/ec2_user` on Amazon Linux, `/home/centos` on CentOS, and `/home/ubuntu` on Ubuntu\)\.
+  `/opt/intel` \- This includes Intel MPI, Intel Parallel Studio, and related files\.
+  `/opt/slurm` \- This includes Slurm Workload Manager and related files\. \(Conditional, only if `Scheduler: slurm`\.\) 

## Troubleshooting issues in NICE DCV<a name="troubleshooting-v3-nice-dcv"></a>

The logs for NICE DCV are written to files in the `/var/log/dcv/` directory\. Reviewing these logs can help to troubleshoot issues\.

The instance type should have at least 1\.7 gibibyte \(GiB\) of RAM to run NICE DCV\. Nano and micro instance types don't have enough memory to run NICE DCV\.

Note: NICE DCV log streams are available in the Dashboard created within the cluster: [Amazon CloudWatch dashboard](Monitoring-v3.md#yaml-Monitoring-Logs-CloudWatch) 

## Troubleshooting issues in clusters with AWS Batch integration<a name="troubleshooting-v3-batch"></a>

### Head node issues<a name="troubleshooting-v3-batch-head-node"></a>

Head node related setup issues can be troubleshooted in the same way as a Slurm cluster \(except for Slurm specific logs\)\. For more information about these issues, see [Head node](#troubleshooting-v3-node-init.head-node)\.

### Compute issues<a name="troubleshooting-v3-batch-compute-nodes"></a>

AWS Batch manages the scaling and compute aspects of your services\. If you encounter compute related issues, see the AWS Batch [troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html) documentation for help\.

### Job failures<a name="troubleshooting-v3-batch-job-fail"></a>

If a job fails, you can run the [`awsbout`](awsbatchcli_awsbout.md) command to retrieve the job output\. You can also run the [`awsbstat`](awsbatchcli.awsbstat-v3.md) command to obtain a link to the job logs stored by Amazon CloudWatch\.
